Authors: Jonathan Kress, Andy Gregoire, Kyle Murphy<br>

This is the final class project for Web Interface Design (CIS 526) at K-State. Using Ruby and Agile techniques, we reimplemented K-State's main website at our own discretion and capabilities.<br>

Although the three of us did not possess much experience with web design prior to this class, we were able to implement several necessary features that we felt were essential to a college website, including:<br>

1. Clean, User-friendly GUI<br>
2. Essential information, such as instructors, events, clubs, courses, etc.<br>
3. Basic Search for the above model classes<br>
4. User Authentication<br>
5. Admin Control<br>
